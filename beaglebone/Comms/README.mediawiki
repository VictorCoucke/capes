<pre>
For the RS485, you just need
config-pin p9.11 uart
config-pin p9.13 uart 
...and then use /dev/ttyS4

For the CAN, you just need
config-pin p9.24 can
config-pin p9.26 can
...and then you can use something like https://gist.github.com/jadonk/90d3462c8569d11fa3f7caf14f4769f1, but replace can0 with can1

For the 4-20mA loop, the ADC overlay should already be loaded and you can
cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_voltage5_raw
cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_voltage6_raw
...but you'll need to do the voltage to data conversion

For the sink drivers, you can do:
# Sink A
config-pin p9.15 gpio
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio48/direction
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio48/value
# Sink B
config-pin p9.23 gpio
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio49/direction
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio49/value
...and that should turn them on.
